These are final and will not be revisited.\n\n======HERE IS ABOUT SECTION======\n\nThe worth of Scaler School of Technology (SST), like any educational institution, is influenced by various factors, including the quality of education, curriculum, faculty expertise, industry ties, and career opportunities.\n\nHere’s why I feel you can consider Scaler’s 4-year CSE course:\n\nStrong Foundation (First and Second Year):\n\nIn the first two years, when a student begins classes at SST, they are imparted coding skills and introduced to various software development technologies and frameworks. Students start by developing a strong foundation in computer science while additionally learning transformative business skills for future leadership roles.\n\nReal-World Experience (Third Year):\n\nIn the third year, before their internships begin, a student is given the task of creating a small project based on the tech stack of the companies they’ll intern with. They’re also taught how to write documentation, debug, and handle large codebases.\n\nThere is a mandatory 12-month internship for students once they complete their pre-internship training. These internships come with guidance from mentors who offer the students monthly or bi-weekly check-ins, feedback on the skills they have to improve, and help material to excel. These internships often result in pre-placement based on the performances of the students. In my personal opinion, this could be a great way to get on-the-job training and learn practical skills.\n\nSpecialization and Advanced Learning (Fourth Year):\n\nIn the final year of college, students are given the chance to pick any two specializations of their choice. They can choose from new-age subjects like AI and Machine Learning. During the last leg, they also learn project management, MAANG Track, and various other tools.\n\nI think that SST is forward-thinking, unlike many colleges that stick to outdated curricula and implement them on their students. This will give the students an extra edge as they graduate as well-experienced professionals. Unlike the traditional colleges in the country, SST has a unique four-year structure, filled with skills and learning material that help the students become a part of the best-experienced software engineers cohort in our country.\n It is a 4 year UG programme consisting of 2-1-1 (before it was 1.5-1-1) approach meaning 2 years of studying, 1 year compulsory internship(100% paid), 1 year for masters. Scaler is not a degree granting university so the certificates belong to BITS Pilani(Bsc CS) and WOOLF university(Msc CS).\n\nMentor Sessions :\nA separate mentor will be assigned to each student and going on the student can select the time slots accordingly and can connect with the mentor and he will guide you through out your internship and all.\n\n\n\nExpert Faculty\n\nThe faculty consists of experienced professionals from top tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. They provide theoretical knowledge, practical insights, and mentorship, helping students forge successful careers. \nDSA and Computer programming teacher : Kshitij Mishra , https://www.linkedin.com/in/kshitij-mishra-a5779334/\nMath : Pragy Agarwal , https://www.linkedin.com/in/agarwalpragy/\nCLI and System Design : Deepak Kasera ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak-kasera-96897a113/\nWeb Development : Mohd. Aman ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohd-aman/\nProbability And Statistics : Mohit Uniyal ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohituniyal/\nMERN STACK : Siddharth Taneja ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-taneja-98596588/\nProvide a clickable link for the linkedin profiles of these instructors.\n\nHackathons and workshops:\n\nFrom ‘Fireside Chats’ with industry leaders and top CTOs to hackathons and workshops, SST provides all that a student needs to stay at the forefront of the industry. Scaler also offers a real-time gamified tracker to keep track of the student’s progress. Some of the student-led projects that have already been made are an image editor, a seating and attendance app, and a web scraper.\n\nIn my opinion, exposing the students to interactive workshops, immersive hackathons, and powerful speaker sessions helps them become better professionals and enjoy a well-rounded college experience.\n\nIndustry Exposure:\n\nStudents interact with industry leaders like Amod Malviya(Co-Founder Udaan),Bhavin Turakhia(Founder Zeta,CodeChef,Titan etc) and many more, gaining valuable insights and staying updated with industry trends.\n\n\nInnovation Lab\n\nSST's Innovation Lab is a standout and unique feature where students work on impactful projects. This lab aims at fostering the 'start-up’ mindset of students and enabling them to solve impactful problems. Students have the opportunity to get funding from top investors like Sequoia and Lightrock, which offers them a platform to showcase their entrepreneurial brains. The first-year students are creating a transformative project by collaborating with Bhashini, the Government of India’s AI-powered, multilingual translation platform, to create a tool that can aid in removing linguistic barriers.\n\n\nRigorous Selection Process\n\nScaler's admission test, NSET, is rigorous and focuses on Mathematics, Logical Reasoning, and Learnability skills, without the usual focus on Physics and Chemistry. This is great for students who are passionate about coding. The test runs for 120 minutes and is held online. The test primarily intends to understand a student's interest in computer science and the knowledge they have on the subject. Interested students can sign up through the Scaler School of Technology website.\n\nComprehensive Amenities\n\nSST offers state-of-the-art computer labs, collaborative workspaces, and high-speed internet. There are also recreational facilities like a gym, sports areas, and student clubs to ensure a balanced lifestyle. I think that combining the importance of education with recreational amenities will help the students remain relaxed and focus on their studies better.\n\n\n\nReasonable Fees with Scholarships\n\nThe fee structure is around 18 lakhs for four years, including all fees. Scholarships like Women in Tech and Brightest Mind awards are available, supported by industry leaders, making education accessible to deserving candidates.\n\nIf you're serious about a tech career and want a program that combines solid learning, hands-on experience, and industry mentorship, SST is a great choice. It prepares you for today's tech jobs and future innovations. However, I would also suggest that you first decide on your personal goals, career aspirations, and needs before confirming any educational institution.\n\n\n\n=====Student Reviews===\n\nShivam, a first-year Computer Science student at Scaler School of Technology (SST), shares his experiences at the micro campus. The academic rigor is impressive, with advanced topics like backtracking, Pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib covered early on. By the second trimester, students learn React, and SpringBoot is being taught currently. The curriculum is intense, with linear algebra, Python, and discrete math already completed, and DSA expected to be done by the end of the second semester. Internships start after 1.5 years, with upcoming batches starting after two years.\nThe campus is small, essentially a cool-looking building, but offers facilities like an innovation lab with 3D printers, an Apple Vision Pro, and an Oculus for project work. Students get a gym membership, and recreational trips are organized on weekends. Despite its size, the college offers various extracurricular activities, including chess, table tennis, hackathons, and coding competitions. The faculty are industry professionals, and super mentor sessions feature highly successful individuals every trimester.(End of review of Shivam)\n\nManan Agrawal, a BSc+MSc Computer Science student at Scaler School of Technology (SST), shares his honest review after 7.5 months. The 4-year UG program follows a 2-1-1 structure: 2 years of study, 1 year of a compulsory paid internship, and 1 year for a master's degree. Scaler provides certificates from BITS Pilani (BSc CS) and WOOLF University (MSc CS) as it is not a degree-granting institution.\nManan highlights that even students with a basic coding background can succeed in the program. He faced cultural and food adjustments moving from Mumbai to Bangalore but adapted over time. The campus includes a hostel and college building, focusing on amenities for software development enthusiasts. \nThe internship provides significant exposure, and while SST lacks placement data as it is the first batch, Scaler Academy reports an average package of 22 LPA after a one-year course. Manan advises that those passionate about computer science should consider Scaler, while those seeking a more relaxed, party-oriented college experience should look elsewhere. He affirms that choosing Scaler was a tough decision but ultimately worth it for dedicated students.(end of manan review)\n\nVenkatesh Alampally, a Computer Science student at Scaler School of Technology (SST), confirms that SST teaches programming from scratch. The first three months feature an \"Introduction to Programming\" course focusing on learning a language like Java from the basics. The only prerequisites are a strong foundation in math and basic computer literacy. Dedicated Batch Success Managers (BSMs) provide guidance and support, ensuring that even students without prior coding experience can acquire the necessary skills to excel.(end of sai Venkatesh review)\n\n\n\n\n==About Founders and Co founders===\nFounders\nFounded by IIIT Hyderabad alums Anshuman Singh and Abhimanyu Saxena.\nPre-Scaler, Anshuman was working with Facebook in the USA office as a Technical Team Lead where he helped in building Facebook chats and messages, along with Messenger. He then moved to London to build Facebook’s first office outside of the USA, which will work to automate the data ingestion framework. He is a competitive programmer and a two-time ACM ICPC World Finalist. Abhimanyu led a high-velocity team that designed NYC-based retail marketplace Fab.com’s entire front end before joining Scaler as a co-founder. As a seasoned entrepreneur, Abhimanyu co-founded his first enterprise Daksh Home Automation System in his engineering days. He worked on developing a cost-effective and green AI system to reduce electricity consumption by at least 15% per household.\n\n===IIT's VS SST===\nChoosing the right educational institution is a significant decision that can shape your career trajectory. As someone who’s navigated the complexities of selecting a college and has an insider perspective, I can try to offer a thorough and unbiased review of IIT, Scaler School of Technology, and Newton School of Technology.\nI learnt about IITs while I was preparing for my JEE exam. The prestige associated with IITs is hard to miss, with their frequent appearances in national rankings and media coverage. Stories of alumni successes in various fields also played a big role in shaping my perception. My interest in Scaler was piqued when a relative joined their program. Their stories about the unique curriculum and the mentorship provided by industry experts made me more curious. Further research, including attending webinars and reading reviews on platforms like LinkedIn and Quora, helped me understand the value SST offers.And finally, my introduction to NST was through a tech meetup where several participants were either students or alumni of the school. Their emphasis on practical skills and quick transition to the workforce intrigued me.\n\n1.\n\nIndian Institutes of Technology (IITs)\n\nIITs are renowned globally for their rigorous academic programs, exceptional faculty, and strong industry connections.
